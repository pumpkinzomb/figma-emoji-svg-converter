## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The app takes Figma emoji SVGs (which often contain text elements for emoji characters) and converts them into SVGs with foreignObject elements. This approach ensures better compatibility and consistent rendering across different platforms and browsers.

The conversion process:
1. Parses the original SVG to extract emoji content
2. Creates a new SVG with a foreignObject containing the emoji
3. Presents the converted SVG for download
